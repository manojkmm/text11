 For NLG you have two ways - One is template based and the other is deep learning based | For Template based NLG - need to use API's like dialogflow (Dialogflow detects intent of the text and depending on the intents , appropriate responses are coded ). Example could be chatbots for HR queries
deep learning based NLG systems are mostly in research state , even though some results are definitely possible , using them in production might be risky as they are not mature enough
the other option is to use commercial NLG systems like , I feel these commercial NLG systems are also in initial development state . They don't give developer licenses yet, only give licenses to corporate clients for testing only. Few commercial NLG systems are listed below

and commercial NLG systems give a lot of hype and promises , but execution in real world scenarios will be different then what is promised
Questions - 1. what is the scope - do you have any use case in mind ? (asking this because in NLG, applications and features vary according to the type of use case and datasets available) |
NLP is a fairly matured subject with lot of open source work and lot of results to show, but NLG is a fairly new area and very little actual real world results to show other than academic papers
these commercial NLG systems might work, but it would very much be dependant on a specific type of industry or any other specific requirement , they might not generalise well to other real world use cases
